In NASM (Netwide Assembler) and the broader context of assembly programming on x86 architecture, the terms `main` and `_start` are closely related but differ in terms of their usage and purpose. Below is an in-depth explanation of each:

### `_start`

1. **Entry Point of the Program:**
   - `_start` is the **entry point** in low-level assembly programs. When a program is executed, the operating system's loader looks for a specific entry point where the execution begins. For programs written in assembly, this entry point is often labeled `_start`.
   - In a program using the Linux syscall interface (for example), the program begins execution at the `_start` label.

2. **No Standard Library Initialization:**
   - In the case of a program that uses `_start`, you typically don't have standard C library initialization, such as setting up `main()` and calling `exit()` or similar.
   - `_start` is a "bare-bones" entry, meaning that any setup or teardown, like setting up the stack or initializing global variables, must be explicitly done by the programmer.
   - This is the starting point of the program where you directly interact with system calls (like `exit()` or `write()`), so there is no automatic handling of return values, memory management, or other facilities that higher-level languages or standard libraries offer.

3. **System Calls:**
   - At `_start`, you'll typically make system calls using `int 0x80` (in older systems) or `syscall` (in modern 64-bit systems) to perform operations like writing output to the screen or exiting the program.

4. **No Stack Setup (unless coded):**
   - The stack is usually not set up automatically in this context, and as such, you must explicitly manage the stack and function call mechanism. This can make assembly programs more complex but also more flexible and efficient.

5. **Example of Program using `_start`:**
   ```asm
   section .data
   msg db 'Hello, world!', 0    ; Null-terminated string

   section .text
   global _start

   _start:
       ; Write "Hello, world!" to stdout (file descriptor 1)
       mov eax, 4            ; syscall number for sys_write (4)
       mov ebx, 1            ; file descriptor for stdout
       mov ecx, msg         ; pointer to the message
       mov edx, 13           ; length of the message
       int 0x80              ; make the syscall

       ; Exit the program (exit code 0)
       mov eax, 1            ; syscall number for sys_exit (1)
       xor ebx, ebx          ; exit status 0
       int 0x80              ; make the syscall
   ```

6. **64-bit Mode:**
   - In 64-bit assembly, the system call mechanism differs (using the `syscall` instruction instead of `int 0x80`), but the concept of `_start` remains largely the same.

### `main`

1. **Standard C/C++ Entry Point:**
   - `main` is the standard entry point for programs written in **C/C++** or higher-level languages. It’s the first function that is called when the program starts execution (after the operating system has initialized the environment for the program).
   - It’s not specific to assembly directly but is important when interfacing with the C standard library, which expects `main()` to be the entry point of the program.
   - In assembly programs that interface with the C standard library, `main` is typically used as the entry point where the program starts executing.

2. **C Runtime (CRT) Setup:**
   - When you use `main` as the entry point, the C runtime will perform various initializations, such as setting up the stack, handling global variables, and ensuring proper program exit.
   - The C library may handle memory allocation, file handling, and I/O. A program using `main` has access to these high-level abstractions.

3. **Calling Conventions:**
   - In `main`, function arguments and return values are managed according to the calling conventions of the platform, such as passing arguments via the stack or registers.
   - When linking with the C library, a `main` function is expected to return an integer (typically `int main()`), which is used as the program’s exit code.

4. **Example of Program using `main` (in Assembly with C runtime):**
   - If you want to write an assembly program that calls `main` (and indirectly calls C functions like `printf`), you might do something like this:
   ```asm
   section .data
   msg db 'Hello, world!', 0

   section .text
   extern printf      ; Declare the external C function printf
   global main        ; Declare the entry point for the C runtime

   main:
       ; Call printf to print the message
       mov rdi, msg     ; First argument (message)
       call printf      ; Call the C function

       ; Return 0 to the operating system (exit status)
       xor eax, eax     ; Set return value to 0
       ret              ; Return from main (C runtime takes care of exit)
   ```

5. **Linking with C Library:**
   - If you write your assembly code with a `main` function and link it with a C runtime, the linker will generate code to call `main` after the initialization of the C runtime environment.
   - When using a C library, the `_start` symbol is usually replaced with `main`, and the C runtime (crt0.o or equivalent) ensures the program starts at `main`.

### Differences Between `_start` and `main`:

| **Aspect**                | **_start**                          | **main**                                  |
|---------------------------|-------------------------------------|-------------------------------------------|
| **Usage**                 | Low-level entry point (direct syscalls) | High-level entry point (C runtime)        |
| **Library Initialization**| No C runtime (no automatic setup)   | Automatically initialized by the C runtime |
| **System Calls**          | Direct system calls (e.g., `write()`, `exit()`) | Standard library functions (e.g., `printf`, `malloc`) |
| **Stack Management**      | Manual stack setup required         | Managed by the C runtime                  |
| **Typical Use Case**      | Bare-metal or system-level programs  | Programs written in C/C++ or other high-level languages |
| **Return Value**          | Exit code via system call (`exit()`) | Return value passed to the operating system |

### When to Use `_start` vs `main`:

- **Use `_start`:** 
  - When you are writing a bare-metal program, low-level system utility, or just want to avoid using the C standard library. `_start` is ideal for more direct control over the program and system interactions.
  
- **Use `main`:** 
  - When you are writing a program that interfaces with the C runtime or wants the convenience of standard library functions, automatic memory management, and other high-level facilities.






----------------------------`question`-------------------------------------------

Modify the assembly program to define main rather than _start.
Assemble it and link it using gee. What is the difference in size of
the executables?

         section . text
         global _start
         _start :
         mov eax , 1
         xor ebx , ebx
         int Ox80


To modify your assembly program so that it uses `main` instead of `_start`, and then assemble and link it using `gcc`, I'll guide you through the steps and explain the key differences in size.



### Modified Assembly Code (Using `main`):

We need to replace the `_start` label with `main` and also ensure the program follows the standard convention for linking with the C runtime. Specifically, we must make sure that the `main` function returns a value to the OS, as the C runtime expects it.

Here’s the modified version:

```asm
section .text
    global main      ; Declare the main entry point

main:
    mov eax, 1        ; Exit system call number (sys_exit)
    mov ebx, 5        ; Status value (return code 5)
    int 0x80          ; Trigger interrupt to invoke the system call
```

### Steps to Assemble and Link:

To assemble and link this program, follow these steps:

1. **Assemble the Code**:
   - Save the above code in a file called `exit.asm`.
   - Use NASM to assemble the code into an object file:
   
   ```bash
   nasm -f elf32 exit.asm -o exit.o
   ```

2. **Link the Program Using `gcc`**:
   - Since we're using `main`, we’ll need to link it using `gcc` (GNU Compiler Collection) to set up the C runtime.
   
   ```bash
   gcc -m32 -o exit_program exit.o
   ```

   This will link the object file into a 32-bit executable, linking it with the C runtime. Since we used `main` as the entry point, the C runtime will perform necessary initialization and termination.

3. **For Comparison, Using `_start`**:
   - If you were using `_start` instead of `main`, you would not link with the C runtime. You would assemble and link it like this:
   
   ```bash
   nasm -f elf32 exit.asm -o exit.o
   ld -m elf_i386 -s -o exit_program_no_crt exit.o
   ```

   Here, `ld` is the GNU linker, and the `-m elf_i386` option specifies a 32-bit architecture. The `-s` flag strips debugging symbols to minimize the executable size.

### Difference in Size of Executables:

- **Using `_start`**:
  - The executable will be smaller because it does not require linking with the C runtime. There is no standard library initialization or handling of global variables.
  - It will only contain the necessary code to make the system call directly, resulting in a minimal size.

- **Using `main`**:
  - The executable will be larger because it is linked with the C runtime. This includes the startup code for setting up the environment, managing the stack, and handling termination via the C library’s `exit()` function.
  - The C runtime adds additional overhead to the executable.

To summarize, the executable generated by using `main` will generally be **larger** because it includes the C runtime support, while using `_start` creates a smaller, more direct executable because it bypasses the runtime and relies on direct system calls.

### Expected Output (Size Difference):
- **Using `main`**: The executable size will be larger due to the inclusion of the C runtime.
- **Using `_start`**: The executable size will be smaller because it’s more minimalistic and doesn’t require the C runtime.

You can compare the sizes of the executables using the `ls -lh` command to see the difference:

```bash
ls -lh main_program
ls -lh start_program_no_crt
```



In this case, you’ll observe that `start_program_no_crt` will typically be smaller than `main_program`.
         
```

┌──(kali㉿DESKTOP-GDG9QEA)-[/mnt/c/Users/bilal/Videos/cpp/chernocpp/Assembly_lang/NASM/main_vs_start]

-rwxrwxrwx 1 kali kali 4.2K Feb 13 18:03 start_program_no_crt
```
         
you can see that the difference is of 15k and 4.2k
         


so comes the question why use main in assemblly 

Linking to the C Runtime (CRT):
When you write assembly for Linux, your program might need to interact with the C runtime library (CRT). In such cases, the main function is often required because it’s the standard entry point expected by the C runtime.
For example, if you use a C library or need system calls to be wrapped with the CRT, having a main function aligns with the expected structure.



## **Using main** :

- When you write assembly that should interface with C libraries or be linked with a C runtime.
- To have a more familiar entry point (main) for ease of debugging or readability.
- If you want to integrate more easily with higher-level programs or use standard system calls or libraries that expect main.

## **Using _start**:

- When writing pure, standalone assembly without the need for a C runtime.
- For low-level control where you manually handle program initialization, system calls, and cleanup.
