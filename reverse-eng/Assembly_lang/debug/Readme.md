# **Debugging formats**:


### 1. **DWARF (Debugging With Attributed Record Formats)**

- **Purpose**: DWARF is one of the most widely used debugging information formats, especially on Unix-like systems. It provides rich debugging information that helps debuggers like **GDB** (GNU Debugger) map machine code back to the original source code.
- **Supported by**: **GCC**, **Clang**, and other compilers targeting Unix/Linux systems.
- **Structure**: It includes detailed information about:
  - **Variable types**
  - **Function names**
  - **Source file names and line numbers**
  - **Stack frames**
  - **Call information**
- **Versions**: Several versions exist, with **DWARF 2** being one of the earlier versions. Newer versions like **DWARF 3**, **4**, and **5** have expanded and improved features.
- **Usage**: Commonly used in debugging and is the default debugging format for many modern compilers and systems (especially on Linux).

### 2. **STABS**

- **Purpose**: STABS is an older debugging format that was used primarily on **Unix-based** systems.
- **Supported by**: Historically, it was supported by compilers like **CC** (the traditional C compiler on Unix) and **GCC**.
- **Structure**: STABS provides information about:
  - **Function names**
  - **Line numbers**
  - **Types of variables**
- **Limitations**: It’s considered less efficient and has more limited support for modern debugging than formats like DWARF. As a result, it has largely been superseded by DWARF in modern systems.
- **Usage**: STABS was used primarily before DWARF became the standard in Unix/Linux-based systems.

### 3. **CodeView**

- **Purpose**: **CodeView** is a debugging format used by **Microsoft** for debugging programs on **Windows**.
- **Supported by**: Primarily used by Microsoft's **Visual Studio** IDE and the **Microsoft C/C++ compiler**.
- **Structure**: It provides information about:
  - **Source code line numbers**
  - **Function names**
  - **Variable information**
  - **Type information**
  - **Stack information**
- **Usage**: CodeView is used mainly in **Windows** environments and is tightly integrated with Microsoft's tools, like **Visual Studio** and **MSVC (Microsoft Visual C++)**.

### 4. **ELF Debugging Information** (often associated with DWARF)

- **Purpose**: **ELF** (Executable and Linkable Format) is a file format used for executable files, object files, shared libraries, and core dumps on **Unix-like** systems. While ELF itself isn't strictly a debugging format, **ELF debugging information** often refers to DWARF-based debug information that is embedded in ELF files.
- **Supported by**: **GCC**, **Clang**, and other compilers for Linux and other Unix-like systems.
- **Structure**: ELF files can contain debugging sections that use **DWARF** to provide detailed debug information.
- **Usage**: On Unix-like systems, ELF files commonly contain embedded DWARF debugging information, which debuggers like **GDB** use to debug programs.

### 5. **PDB (Program Database)**

- **Purpose**: **PDB** is a debugging format developed by **Microsoft** for use with their **Visual Studio** IDE and **MSVC (Microsoft Visual C++)** compiler.
- **Supported by**: Primarily used by **Microsoft Visual Studio** and related Microsoft tools.
- **Structure**: PDB files store:
  - **Symbol information** (function names, variable names, types)
  - **Line number information**
  - **Stack information**
- **Usage**: The **PDB** format is the standard debugging information format for applications built using **Microsoft Visual Studio** and is essential for debugging on Windows platforms. PDB files can also be used for crash dumps and post-mortem debugging.

### 6. **XCOFF (Extended Common Object File Format)**

- **Purpose**: **XCOFF** is an extension of the **COFF** (Common Object File Format) used primarily on **IBM AIX** systems.
- **Supported by**: **IBM AIX** (a Unix variant for IBM systems).
- **Structure**: XCOFF files can contain:
  - **Debug information** (similar to DWARF but specific to AIX systems)
  - **Symbol information**
  - **Line numbers**
- **Usage**: XCOFF is used on IBM AIX systems, and it’s common in enterprise environments that rely on AIX for large-scale applications. It includes both debugging and binary data in the object files.

### 7. **Intel Debugging Format**

- **Purpose**: This is a proprietary debugging format used by **Intel** tools.
- **Supported by**: **Intel’s development tools** (e.g., Intel’s **ICC** compiler, Intel Debugger).
- **Structure**: Intel’s debugging format provides debugging information similar to other formats but may be more tailored to Intel's hardware and compiler-specific features.
- **Usage**: Intel’s debugging format is mainly used for debugging applications compiled with Intel's compilers, especially those targeting Intel hardware and using **Intel-specific instruction sets**.

### Conclusion:
- **DWARF** and **PDB** are the most common formats used today in most development environments, with **DWARF** used on Unix-like systems (Linux, macOS) and **PDB** used in Windows (Visual Studio).
- Other formats like **STABS** and **XCOFF** are more legacy or platform-specific (e.g., for Unix-based systems or IBM AIX).
