# The Fetch-Execute Cycle

One of the earliest electronic computers was the ENIAC. When it was first built it could not store programs. Each new computation required moving plugs and jumper cables. Now, however, nearly all computers store programs. For these computers, doing a computation means running a program. The place where the program is stored is called memory. The part of the machine which does the computation is called the processor. Computer programs generally take the form of a list of instructions. Computation is performed by the processor using the fetch-execute cycle. The fetch-execute cycle consists of a repeated process that includes these steps:

1. Step 1.
The processor fetches an instruction from memory.
2. Step 2.
The processor executes the instruction.
3. Step 3.
the processor cycles back to step 1

Probably the most important examples of computers which are not based on the fetch-execute cycle are DNA computers and quantum computers. Of course it may be that these computers will reach a point in their development when they are ready to leave university laboratories and that by that time, they too will run stored programs.
