# Linux x86 Program Start Up or - How the heck do we get to main()?

This is for people who want to understand how programs get loaded under linux. In particular it talks about dynamically loaded x86 ELF files. The information you learn will let you understand how to debug problems that occur in your program before main starts up

## How did we get to main?

We're going to build the simplest C program possible, an empty main, and then we're going to look at the disassembly of it to see how we get to main. We'll see that the first thing that's run is a function linked to every program named `_start` which eventually leads to your program's main being run.

```c
int
main()
{
}
```

```bash
gcc -ggdb -o prog1 prog1.c
```

to get the dissassembly use this command

```bash
objdump -d prog1 >prog1.dump
```

## But first, how do we get to `_start`?

When you run a program, whether from a shell or a graphical user interface (GUI), the system essentially uses the `execve()` system call to load and execute the program.

The shell or GUI is responsible for invoking this system call. The execve() function replaces the current running process (the shell or GUI itself) with the new program you want to execute

If you want to learn more about how the execve() system call works, you can type man execve in your terminal. This will bring up the manual page for execve(), which provides detailed information about its usage, parameters, and behavior.

When execve() is called to execute a new program, it prepares a stack for the new program to run. The stack is used to store important data such as `command-line arguments` and `environment variables`.

The stack contains:

- argc: This is the number of command-line arguments passed to the program.
- argv: This is an array of strings containing the actual command-line arguments.
- envp: This is an array of strings containing the environment variables passed to the program (such as PATH, HOME, etc.).

## File Descriptors

In Unix-like operating systems, there are three standard file descriptors for every running process:

- 0: Standard input (stdin)
- 1: Standard output (stdout)
- 2: Standard error (stderr)

When execve() is invoked, it doesnâ€™t modify these file descriptors. It assumes that these file descriptors have already been set up by the calling process (such as the shell). This means that if you're executing a command in the shell, the input and output of your program will behave as expected (e.g., input comes from the terminal, output goes to the terminal, and errors go to the terminal unless redirected)

so The file descriptions 0, 1, and 2, (stdin, stdout, stderr), are left to whatever the shell set them to.

After execve() has set up the stack and prepared the necessary environment, the loader takes over. The loader is responsible for loading the program into memory and performing relocations.

Relocations involve adjusting memory addresses in the program's code, so it can run correctly in the system's memory. For example, the program may use shared libraries, and the loader ensures that the program can find the correct addresses for these libraries when running.

The loader may also prepare other things, like setting up the initial state of the program, so it is ready to run.

When everything is ready, control is handed to your program by calling `_start()`

`_start` is, oddly enough, where we start

```bash
080482e0 <_start>:
80482e0:       31 ed                   xor    %ebp,%ebp
80482e2:       5e                      pop    %esi
80482e3:       89 e1                   mov    %esp,%ecx
80482e5:       83 e4 f0                and    $0xfffffff0,%esp
80482e8:       50                      push   %eax
80482e9:       54                      push   %esp
80482ea:       52                      push   %edx
80482eb:       68 00 84 04 08          push   $0x8048400
80482f0:       68 a0 83 04 08          push   $0x80483a0
80482f5:       51                      push   %ecx
80482f6:       56                      push   %esi
80482f7:       68 94 83 04 08          push   $0x8048394
80482fc:       e8 c3 ff ff ff          call   80482c4 <__libc_start_main@plt>
8048301:       f4                      hlt
```

xor of anything with itself sets it to zero. so the `xor %ebp,%ebp` sets %ebp to zero. This is suggested by the ABI (Application Binary Interface specification), to mark the outermost frame.

Next we pop off the top of the stack. On entry we have argc, argv and envp on the stack, so the pop makes argc go into %esi. We're just going to save it and push it back on the stack in a minute. Since we popped off `argc`, %esp is now pointing at `argv`. The mov puts argv into %ecx without moving the stack pointer.

Then we and the stack pointer with a mask that clears off the bottom four bits. `and    $0xfffffff0,%esp`
Depending on where the stack pointer was it will move it lower, by 0 to 15 bytes.

16-byte alignment refers to the practice of arranging data in memory such that the address of the data is a multiple of 16 bytes (0x10 in hexadecimal). This means that the memory address where the data starts should be divisible by 16.

This is an important operation, particularly in modern architectures and for ensuring the proper functioning of certain hardware and software features.

- Memory Alignment for Performance:

  Memory alignment is a key consideration for modern CPUs. Accessing memory that is properly aligned (to boundaries like 16 bytes) can be much faster than accessing unaligned memory. Misaligned memory access can cause performance penalties or even faults on certain architectures.

- SSE (Streaming SIMD Extensions) Requirements:

  Modern CPUs often use SIMD instructions like SSE to perform operations on multiple pieces of data at once (e.g., processing 4 single-precision floating-point numbers simultaneously). These instructions often require that the data being processed is aligned on 16-byte boundaries for correct operation. If the stack pointer (%esp) is not aligned, accessing the data could cause SSE exceptions or degrade performance

- ABI (Application Binary Interface) Convention:

  The ABI specification for many platforms (such as Linux x86-64) requires that the stack pointer be aligned to 16-byte boundaries when entering functions, particularly when calling certain library functions.

<br>

Suppose %esp initially points to some address, say 0x12345678.

Applying the and $0xfffffff0, %esp operation would modify %esp to align it to the nearest 16-byte boundary, which would be 0x12345670. The lower 4 bits are cleared, ensuring it is aligned to a multiple of 16.

This alignment is done so that all of the stack variables are likely to be nicely aligned for memory and cache efficiency, in particular, this is required for SSE (Streaming SIMD Extensions), instructions that can work on vectors of single precision floating point simultaneously.

## Now set up for calling `__libc_start_main`

So now we start pushing arguments for `__libc_start_main` onto the stack.

```bash
80482e8:       50                      push   %eax
80482e9:       54                      push   %esp
80482ea:       52                      push   %edx
80482eb:       68 00 84 04 08          push   $0x8048400
80482f0:       68 a0 83 04 08          push   $0x80483a0
80482f5:       51                      push   %ecx
80482f6:       56                      push   %esi
80482f7:       68 94 83 04 08          push   $0x8048394
```

The first one, %eax is garbage pushed onto the stack just because 7 things are going to be pushed on the stack and they needed an 8th one to keep the 16-byte alignment. It's never used for anything.

`__libc_start_main` is linked in from glibc. In the source tree for glibc, it lives in csu/libc-start.c. `__libc_start_main` is specified like

```c
int __libc_start_main(  int (*main) (int, char * *, char * *),
			    int argc, char * * ubp_av,
			    void (*init) (void),
			    void (*fini) (void),
			    void (*rtld_fini) (void),
			    void (* stack_end));
```

So we expect `_start` to push those arguments on the stack in reverse order before the call to `__libc_start_main`.

### 1. **`rtld_fini` (Runtime Linker Destructor)**:

- **Role**: This function is the **destructor of the dynamic linker** and is responsible for cleaning up the dynamic linker and any resources it used during the programâ€™s execution. It is related to unloading shared libraries and performing necessary finalization steps for the dynamic linker itself.
- **Purpose**: It is registered by the `__libc_start_main` function (or other similar startup functions) and is part of the programâ€™s dynamic loading process. The dynamic linker loads and links shared libraries during program startup, and `rtld_fini` handles cleanup when the program finishes, particularly in relation to the shared libraries.
- **Where it is used**: `rtld_fini` is involved in the process of finalizing the environment of dynamically loaded libraries and their destructors. It is passed via the `rtld_fini` argument in `__libc_start_main` and is executed before the program exits.

### 2. **`fini` (Programâ€™s C-level Destructor)**:

- **Role**: This function, often **`__libc_csu_fini`**, is the **C-level destructor of the program**. It handles cleanup tasks specific to the program itself, especially for static variables and any finalization required for the programâ€™s own resources.
- **Purpose**: `fini` is used for program-specific cleanup (like cleaning up static variables or performing any final actions before the program completely terminates). It is registered by `__libc_start_main` using the `__cxat_exit()` mechanism to ensure that destructors of dynamically linked libraries are called when the program exits.
- **Where it is used**: It is called after all dynamic linkers' destructors (`rtld_fini`) and is responsible for cleaning up program-specific resources (like calling destructors of global/static variables in the main program).

## envp

Did you notice that we didn't get envp, the pointer to our environment variables off the stack? It's not one of the arguments to `__libc_start_main`, either. But we know that main is called int main(int argc, char** argv, char** envp) so what's up?

When the program starts, `__libc_start_main` is called, and it first invokes `__libc_init_first`. This function uses internal knowledge to locate the environment variables (`envp`), which are placed right after the argument vector (`argv`) in memory. It finds them by looking just past the **null terminator** that marks the end of the argument list. Once it identifies the environment variables, it sets a global variable called `__environ` to point to them. This allows `__libc_start_main` and other parts of the program to access the environment variables later on. Additionally, just after the environment variables, thereâ€™s another section of memory called the **ELF auxiliary vector**, which contains additional information passed to the process by the loader. You can view this auxiliary vector by setting the environment variable `LD_SHOW_AUXV=1` before running the program.

```bash
The auxiliary vector is a special structure used in the Linux operating system to pass additional information from the dynamic linker/loader to a running program when it is started. It is primarily used to convey useful system-level information about the environment in which the program is running, such as memory layout, program entry point, and other critical runtime details
```

```bash
export LD_SHOW_AUXV=1
./cpp
```

| **Content**            | Key-value pairs (e.g., `PATH=/usr/bin`, `HOME=/home/user`).                                         | System-level values (e.g., `AT_PAGESZ`, `AT_ENTRY`, `AT_HWCAP`).                                                         |
| **Source**             | Set by the user or shell before running the program.                                                | Set by the operating system when the program starts.                                                                     |

In summary:

- **envp** contains user-configurable environment variables that the program can use to interact with the system or control its behavior.
- **auxv** contains low-level system information that is passed by the OS to the program to provide it with details about the environment it's running in, such as system architecture and memory page size.

if that was not enough for you then see this [example](./envp.md) this will give you an idea of `envp`

note : to unset the `LD_SHOW_AUXV` use

```bash
unset LD_SHOW_AUXV
```

now your program will work as normal or you could restart the terminal again

few!!! lets get back to `__libc_start_main` which calls `__libc_init_first`

```c
void __libc_init_first(int argc, char *arg0, ...)
{
    char **argv = &arg0, **envp = &argv[argc + 1];
    __environ = envp;   // converting the argument vector to global
    __libc_init (argc, argv, envp);
}
```

this is about as much as we are going to cover about `__libc_start_main`
but in general, it

- Takes care of some security problems with `setuid` `setgid` programs

  setuid and setgid are special flags that can be set on executables or scripts, allowing them to run with the privileges of the user who owns the file (often root), rather than the user who runs the program. This is commonly used for programs that need elevated privileges, such as changing system settings.

- Starts up `threading`
- Registers the `fini` (our program), and `rtld_fini` (run-time loader) arguments to get run by `at_exit` to run the program's and the loader's cleanup routines
- Calls the `init` argument
- Calls the `main` with the `argc` and `argv` arguments passed to it and with the global `__environ` argument as detailed above.
- Calls `exit` with the return value of main

## Calling the init argument

The init argument, to `__libc_start_main`, is set to `__libc_csu_init` which is also linked into our code. It's compiled from a C program which lives in the glibc source tree in csu/elf-init.c and linked into our program. The C code is similar to (but with a lot more #ifdefs)

`__libc_csu_init` is a function in the GNU C Library (glibc) that is called during the initialization of a program, specifically in the startup process before the `main()` function is invoked. It is part of the program's setup to handle various initialization tasks, particularly for programs that require elevated privileges (like those using `setuid` or `setgid`). This function is compiled from a source file (`csu/elf-init.c`) in the glibc source tree and linked into the final executable. The main responsibilities of `__libc_csu_init` include performing security checks (such as clearing out dangerous environment variables), handling library initialization, and setting the correct user and group IDs for the program. It ensures that the program starts with the right environment and privileges, reducing the risk of security vulnerabilities before the `main()` function starts executing.

```c
void
__libc_csu_init (int argc, char **argv, char **envp)
{

  _init ();

  const size_t size = __init_array_end - __init_array_start;
  for (size_t i = 0; i < size; i++)
      (*__init_array_start [i]) (argc, argv, envp);
}
```

The `__libc_csu_init` function is crucial for setting up a program when it starts executing. Even though the term "constructor" is often associated with C++, the concept of constructors and destructors actually existed long before C++ and applies to C programs as well. Every executable has a C-level constructor (`__libc_csu_init`) and a C-level destructor (`__libc_csu_fini`). These functions are responsible for initializing and cleaning up the environment for the program.

The `__libc_csu_init` function is executed when the program starts, before entering the `main()` function. This function's role is to search for and call any global C-level constructors that the program may have, ensuring that they are executed properly before the main logic begins. Although it may feel like the concept of constructors and destructors belongs to C++, these functions are used in C programs as well, and they are often referred to as "initializers" (for constructors) and "finalizers" (for destructors). This mechanism allows a C program to have setup and teardown routines similar to those in C++.

# something intresting:

Not much to talk about here, but I thought you'd want to see it. The get_pc_thunk thing is a little interesting.

<`__i686.get_pc_thunk.bx`> what is this

A "thunk" in programming, especially in low-level systems programming, is a small piece of code that acts as an intermediary to modify the control flow or perform some setup before jumping to the target code. It essentially "thunks" or "wraps" around another function or action to adjust something before that function is executed.

## Position-Independent Code (PIC):

This code involves involves **position-independent code (PIC)**, which is code designed to run correctly regardless of its memory address. This is crucial for shared libraries, where the code must work no matter where it's loaded in memory.

we seem to be looking at some assembly code related to position-independent code (PIC) and the **Global Offset Table (GOT)**, which is part of how dynamic linking works in such code.

Here's whatâ€™s going on step-by-step:

1. **The Goal of Position-Independent Code**:

   - Position-independent code is meant to run correctly regardless of where it is loaded in memory.
   - To do this, the code needs to access certain global variables or functions, but the addresses of those variables or functions are not known until runtime (when the code is actually loaded into memory). This is where the Global Offset Table (GOT) comes inâ€”it holds addresses to variables and functions that the program can access.

2. **`__get_pc_thunk_bx`**:
   - The `__get_pc_thunk_bx` function is a special assembly function used in PIC to obtain the correct address of the **Global Offset Table** (GOT).
   - The basic problem being solved is how to get the correct address of the **GOT** when the code is not at a fixed memory address.
3. **The Code**:

   - The code involves a **call** to `__get_pc_thunk_bx`. Hereâ€™s a breakdown of what happens:

   ```asm
   push %ebx                       ; Save the value in the ebx register
   call __get_pc_thunk_bx          ; Call __get_pc_thunk_bx, which gets the current address
   add $_GLOBAL_OFFSET_TABLE_, %ebx ; Adds the offset to the base of the GOT
   ```

4. **The `__get_pc_thunk_bx` Function**:

   ```asm
   __get_pc_thunk_bx:
   movel (%esp), %ebx    ; Move the return address from the stack (the address after the call) into ebx
   return                ; Return, which jumps to the address stored in ebx (the return address)
   ```

   - The call instruction pushes the return address (the address of the instruction following the `call` to `__get_pc_thunk_bx`) onto the stack.
   - Inside the `__get_pc_thunk_bx` function, this return address is popped into `%ebx`, so that `%ebx` now holds the address of the next instruction.
   - The `return` instruction then pops the value off the stack and jumps back to the address of the instruction that follows the `call`.
   - The key trick here is that the return address will be the address where the instruction after the `call` was located, which is important because that's the code we're trying to calculate the offset from in order to access the GOT.

5. **Adding the Offset**:
   - After returning from `__get_pc_thunk_bx`, the next instruction adds `$_GLOBAL_OFFSET_TABLE_` (a symbol representing the address of the GOT) to `%ebx`.
   - This allows the code to compute the correct address for the global offset table, enabling the code to access global variables or functions that are stored in the GOT.

### Why All This Is Needed:

- In position-independent code, addresses of global variables or functions are not known at compile time.
- The GOT holds these addresses, but since the code could be loaded at any address in memory, it needs to use a **thunk** (a helper function like `__get_pc_thunk_bx`) to dynamically calculate the correct address of the GOT and the data/functions inside it.

### A More Concrete Example:

Imagine you have a global variable `myVar` that is part of a shared library. In a typical program, the compiler would just use the address of `myVar` directly. But in a shared library (using PIC), the actual address of `myVar` isnâ€™t known until runtime. So, the code uses the GOT to store the address of `myVar` (which is fixed at runtime), and the program uses the thunk to get that address dynamically.

The **thunk** is a tiny helper function that sets up the address of the Global Offset Table (GOT) in position-independent code. It's part of the machinery that allows dynamic linking, so even though your code doesnâ€™t know the exact memory location of global data and functions when itâ€™s compiled, it can calculate those addresses at runtime and continue execution.

## loop ?

```asm
80483eb:       83 c6 01                add    $0x1,%esi
80483ee:       39 fe                   cmp    %edi,%esi
80483f0:       72 de                   jb     80483d0 <__libc_csu_init+0x30>
```

The loop from `__libc_csu_init` will be discussed in a minute after we discuss the init() call that really calls `_init`. For now, just remember that it calls any C level initializers for our program.

---

## `_init` gets the call

Ok, the loader handed control to `_start`, who called `__libc_start_main` who called `__libc_csu_init` who now calls `_init`.

that is what we have learned so far

```asm
08048274 <_init>:

 8048287:       8b 93 fc ff ff ff       mov    -0x4(%ebx),%edx
