# ELF

**ELF** stands for **Executable and Linkable Format**, and it is a common standard file format for executables, object code, shared libraries, and core dumps. ELF is primarily used on Unix-based systems, including Linux, but it is also supported by other operating systems like Solaris, BSD, and others.

### ELF Overview

ELF was designed to be flexible, extensible, and platform-independent, providing a unified file format for various types of executables. It is used by operating systems to execute programs, link shared libraries, and manage core dumps for debugging.
