# BCC

**BCC** stands for **BPF Compiler Collection**. It‚Äôs a toolkit that helps you trace and monitor what‚Äôs happening **inside the Linux kernel**, without stopping or restarting the system.

Think of it like a high-tech magnifying glass that lets you watch exactly how the operating system behaves in real time ‚Äî useful for debugging, performance analysis, and security checks.

### **Why do we need BCC?**

Debugging or monitoring what happens **between** your apps and the OS (like reading files, accessing memory, etc.) is very tricky because:

- A lot of it happens in the kernel, which is low-level and hard to see.
- Modifying the kernel to add print/debug statements is dangerous.
- Most tools slow down the system or miss key events.

**BCC solves this** by providing:
‚úÖ Safe kernel tracing  
‚úÖ Low impact on performance  
‚úÖ Real-time visibility  
‚úÖ Tools for both system-wide and process-specific monitoring

### **What is eBPF?**

- **eBPF** stands for **extended Berkeley Packet Filter**.
- Originally made for filtering network traffic.
- Now, it‚Äôs like a **mini-programming engine inside the Linux kernel**.

With **eBPF**, you can write small programs that the kernel runs safely. These programs can **observe**, **analyze**, and even **respond** to system events like:

- File opens
- System calls
- Network packets
- Disk reads/writes

üí° Think of eBPF like giving the kernel tiny, safe ‚Äúplugins‚Äù that can watch its internal behavior.

### **How do BCC and eBPF work together?**

Writing raw eBPF programs is hard ‚Äî you need to write low-level C code.

So the **BCC toolkit** makes it easier by:

1. Letting you write tools in **Python**.
2. Embedding small bits of **C code** (eBPF programs) inside.
3. Automatically compiling and loading the code into the running kernel.
4. Showing you clean, readable output from tracing events.

### **Example BCC Tools**

Let‚Äôs look at a few tools BCC gives you out of the box:

#### 1. `disksnoop.py`

Monitors disk I/O (reads/writes) in real-time:

```bash
./disksnoop.py
```

**Output:**

```
TIME(s)     T    BYTES    LAT(ms)
1946.2918   R       8     0.27
1948.3458   W    8192     0.96
```

- `T`: Read (`R`) or Write (`W`)
- `BYTES`: Size of I/O operation
- `LAT(ms)`: Latency (time taken)

#### 2. `opensnoop -p <PID>`

Monitors `open()` system calls **just for a specific process**:

```bash
./opensnoop -p 1225
```

If a process with PID `1225` tries to open a file, you‚Äôll see exactly which file and when.

### **Is it safe to use on real systems?**

Yes ‚Äî that‚Äôs a big strength of BCC.

‚úÖ It works on live, production Linux systems  
‚úÖ Has **very little performance impact**  
‚úÖ eBPF code is verified before loading, so it can‚Äôt crash or slow the system

### **How it all fits together**

```text
        Python Script (BCC Tool)
                ‚Üì
         Embedded eBPF (in C)
                ‚Üì
    BCC compiles & loads it into the Kernel
                ‚Üì
     Kernel runs the code safely using eBPF
                ‚Üì
   Real-time tracing output sent to user space
```
