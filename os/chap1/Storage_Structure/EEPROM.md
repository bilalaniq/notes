# Electrically Erasable Programmable Read-Only Memory (EEPROM)

EPROM stands for Erasable Programmable Read-Only Memory is a kind of nonvolatile memory used in computers and other electronic devices for storing data that must be retained even when the power is turned off. Unlike standard ROM (Read Only Memory) which is permanently programmed at the time of manufacturing. EPROM can be programmed again and erased a number of times making it a versatile choice for storing firmware and other important software.

It is a memory chip that is non-volatile in nature that is it can hold the data even after the power supply is stopped. It can be reused again and again as it is easily programmable and erasable. A chip that uses ultraviolet (UV) light to write and erase data is called an EPROM Each transistor in the array that makes up the chip has the capacity to store a small amount of data. A specialized tool known as a `programmer` is used to program these transistors by applying high voltage to the chip to store data. The chip is exposed to UV radiation when it becomes essential to erase the data, which resets all of the transistors to their initial states.

## Types of EPROM Technology

There are mainly two types of EPROM technology exist

- UV-EPROM: Programming a UV-EPROM requires a high voltage. As the name suggests it is removed by passing UV light through the chipâ€™s window. The majority of UV-EPROM chips have a 20-year data retention period and a high read cycle count.

- One-Time Programmable (OTP) EPROM: EPROM that can be programmed once (OTP). With one significant exception an OTP EPROM is comparable to a UV-EPROM: it lacks a UV light window and is hence difficult to erase. OTP EPROMs can occasionally be completely deleted using X-rays in their starting point.

## Example

The iPhone uses EEPROM to store serial numbers and hardware
information about the device.

## Conclusion

EPROM contributed significantly to the advancement of computer hardware by striking a balance between adaptability and durability. It has becoming a more popular option for [firmware](./firmware.md) storage in a wider range of devices due to its long term data preservation and ability to be programmed again. EPROM is less used in modern applications because of the introduction of [Flash memory](./Flash_memory.md) and other technologies. Despite this its impact on the history of computers has been enormous.
