# **Threads**

### **What is a Thread?**

A **thread** is the smallest unit of execution within a process. It represents a sequence of instructions that the CPU processes. A **process** is a running program, and each process can have multiple threads that execute different parts of the program concurrently.

Think of a process as a **book**, and threads as **multiple readers** who read different sections of the book at the same time. This improves efficiency and performance.

## **Types of Threads**

There are two main types of threads:

### **1. User-Level Threads (ULT)**

- Managed at the **application** level.
- The **OS does not know about them**.
- Faster to create and switch between.
- If one thread blocks (e.g., waiting for I/O), the entire process blocks.
- Used in lightweight multithreading libraries like **POSIX Threads (Pthreads), Java Threads, etc.**.

### **2. Kernel-Level Threads (KLT)**

- Managed by the **operating system**.
- OS schedules and controls them.
- Slower to create and switch compared to user threads.
- If one thread blocks, others can continue execution.
- Used in **Windows, Linux, and MacOS kernel-based threading models**.

## **Threads vs. Processes**

| Feature           | Process                                                | Thread                                               |
| ----------------- | ------------------------------------------------------ | ---------------------------------------------------- |
| **Definition**    | A running program instance.                            | A unit of execution within a process.                |
| **Memory Space**  | Each process has its own memory.                       | Threads share memory of the process.                 |
| **Communication** | Uses **Inter-Process Communication (IPC)** (slow).     | Threads share memory, making communication faster.   |
| **Overhead**      | More overhead (switching between processes is costly). | Less overhead (switching between threads is faster). |
| **Example**       | Running two browsers (Chrome and Firefox).             | Multiple tabs in Chrome, each running as a thread.   |

## **Multithreading**

**Multithreading** allows multiple threads within a process to execute concurrently, improving performance. There are two types:

### **1. Parallel Multithreading**

- Multiple threads run **simultaneously** on **multiple CPU cores**.
- Requires **multi-core processors**.
- Example: A **quad-core CPU** can run **four threads at once**.

### **2. Concurrent Multithreading**

- Threads take turns running on the **same core**.
- Used when the CPU has fewer cores than threads.
- Example: A **dual-core CPU with 4 threads** executes two at a time and switches between them.

---

## **Hyper-Threading (Intel) / Simultaneous Multithreading (AMD)**

- A **single CPU core** handles **multiple threads**.
- Increases CPU efficiency but does **not double performance**.
- Example: Your **Intel Core i7-6600U has 2 physical cores but supports 4 threads**, meaning each core handles **two threads simultaneously**.

## **Benefits of Multithreading**

✅ **Better CPU utilization** – Keeps the CPU busy and reduces idle time.  
✅ **Faster execution** – Multiple tasks can run in parallel.  
✅ **Efficient multitasking** – Run multiple applications smoothly.  
✅ **Better responsiveness** – UI remains responsive even during heavy processing.

### **Where Is Multithreading Used?**

- **Web Browsers** – Each tab runs as a separate thread.
- **Video Editing & 3D Rendering** – Uses multiple threads to speed up processing.
- **Gaming** – Modern games use multiple threads for AI, physics, and rendering.
- **Servers & Databases** – Handle thousands of requests concurrently.

## **Limitations of Threads**

❌ **Synchronization Issues** – Threads share memory, leading to race conditions.  
❌ **Overhead in Thread Management** – Creating and managing too many threads can slow down the system.  
❌ **Not All Tasks Benefit** – Some tasks cannot be parallelized effectively.

## **Conclusion**

A thread is a **lightweight unit of execution** within a process. Multithreading **improves performance** but requires careful management. Technologies like **Hyper-Threading** make CPUs more efficient, but actual speed gains depend on how well software is optimized for multithreading.
