# Echo

- A client communicates with an “echo” server
- The server simply echoes whatever it receives back to the client

In client-server socket programming, an echo server is a simple application that listens for incoming client connections, receives data, and sends the exact same data back to the client. This is often used as a basic example for learning socket programming.

i have created ECHO server for both [stream(TCP)](./stream/Readme.md) and [datagram(UDP)](./datagram/Readme.md)
