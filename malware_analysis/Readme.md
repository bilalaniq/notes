# Definition of Malware Analysis

Malware analysis involves examining a potential malware sample to understand its type, functions, and the risks it poses.

Researchers conduct this analysis to gain crucial threat intelligence, respond to cybersecurity incidents, and enhance a company’s defenses.

### Benefits of Malware Analysis

Imagine a corporate computer infected with new malware, like ransomware. If the malware spreads across the network, it could lead to significant financial losses or loss of vital data.

Security researchers aim to

- ### identify the type of malware
- ### understand its operation
- ### assess the potential damage
- ### detect network and host indicators

The analysis helps answer key questions:

- ## What does the malware do?
- ## How can it be detected on the network?
- ## How to assess and minimize the damage?
- ## How to prevent future attacks?

In some cases, you might need additional information from external sources. For instance, extracting network and host indicators and searching them in external systems can provide more indicators of compromise and insights into the malware’s behavior that might not be evident from your sample alone.

# Types of Malware Analysis

- ### Static analysis

  Static analysis examines a suspicious file without executing it, offering insights that help create static signatures. For example, by analyzing code, researchers might find IP addresses and URLs pointing to a malware control server. Static analysis can also identify the file type and calculate a hash sum, useful for signature creation. However, its limitations include the risk of being misled by obfuscated code, a common technique in advanced malware.

- ### Dynamic analysis

  Dynamic analysis involves running malware samples in a controlled environment to observe the processes triggered in the system. Tools like Process Monitor and Process Explorer are commonly used. To safely perform dynamic analysis, it’s crucial to use a virtual machine, ensuring the malware doesn’t cause real damage

- ### Interactive analysis

  Interactive analysis is a more advanced form of dynamic analysis, allowing researchers to control the malware’s execution and respond to it in real time. This method offers the most realistic simulation, letting analysts interact with pop-ups or modify OS configurations during the process. It’s particularly useful when dealing with sophisticated malware, like banking Trojans, which only activate under specific conditions.

  All these actions are difficult to implement using automated analysis tools.

# Stages of Malware Analysis

Malware analysis can be broken down into several stages. Sometimes, only a few steps are needed, but using all of them provides the most comprehensive understanding.

- ### Reverse code Analysis

  This advanced stage involves reverse engineering the binary file to understand its workings. It requires specialized skills and tools like disassemblers and debuggers. While some might skip this step due to its complexity, it often reveals critical insights into the malware.

- ### Interactive Behavioral analysis

  The suspicious file is executed in a controlled lab environment to observe its behavior. Analysts monitor in real-time how the malware interacts with external hosts, launches processes, and creates tasks, providing a detailed log of the program’s activities.

- ### static property analysis

  This stage involves examining static properties like strings, encoded data fragments, or compiled code sequences. The goal is to find malicious patterns, which can later become indicators of compromise.

- ### fully automated analysis

  This method quickly identifies malware by using automated systems to detect its presence. Although it’s fast, the depth of analysis is limited compared to expert reviews.

### Lesson Summary

- Malware Analysis is the process of examining a malware sample.
- There are three main types: static, dynamic, and interactive.
- Malware analysis enables you to:
- investigate security incidents
- understand the malware’s mechanisms
- obtain Indicators of Compromise (IOC)
