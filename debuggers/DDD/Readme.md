# DDD

Due to the more recent popularity of graphical user interfaces (GUIs),
a number of GUI-based debuggers have been developed that run under Unix. Most of these are GUI front ends to GDB: The user issues commands via the GUI, which in turn passes them on to GDB. One of these
is DDD, the Data Display Debugger.
If your system does not already have DDD installed, you can download it. For instance, on Fedora Linux systems, the command

```bash
yum install ddd
```

will take care of the entire process for you. In Ubuntu Linux, a similar
command, apt-get, can be used.
