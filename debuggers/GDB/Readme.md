# GDB

The most commonly used debugging tool among Unix programmers
is GDB, the GNU Project Debugger developed by Richard Stallman, a
prominent leader of the open source software movement, which played
a key role in the development of Linux.
Most Linux sytems should have GDB preinstalled. If it is not, you
must download the GCC compiler package
