/*
OpenSSL is a robust, full-featured toolkit for Secure Sockets Layer (SSL) and Transport Layer Security (TLS) protocols. It also 
includes a comprehensive suite of cryptographic algorithms and protocols for various applications in security, encryption, and 
certificate management. It is widely used in various software and networking applications for implementing secure communication 
over the internet.

In C++ applications, you can make use of the OpenSSL library to perform encryption, decryption, hashing, key generation, SSL/TLS 
communication, and much more.
