// -------------------------------------------standard templete library----------------------------------
/*
"STL" stands for the Standard Template Library. It's a collection of classes and functions in C++ providing common data structures 
(like arrays, lists, stacks, and queues) and algorithms (like sorting and searching) that can be readily used. The STL is a powerful 
tool for developers as it provides efficient, tested, and reusable components.

it is an library containg containers it called templete library because it can be templete into anything meaning that the data type is up to
you to decide what will it be but you donot need to know about templetes to work with STL beacause the data structure is automatically handled
 

The STL consists of several key components:
>>>Containers:     we will learn in future

>>>Iterators: Iterators are objects used to traverse and manipulate elements within containers. They act as pointers to elements 
within the container and provide a uniform way to access elements regardless of the underlying container type.

>>>Algorithms: The STL provides a wide range of algorithms for performing common operations on containers. These algorithms are 
designed to work with iterators and provide efficient implementations of operations such as sorting, searching, transforming, and 
manipulating data.

>>>Function Objects (Functors): Functors are objects that can be invoked as if they were functions. They are often used as 
arguments to algorithms to customize their behavior
