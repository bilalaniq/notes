// -----------------------------stack---------------------------------
/* The stack is a region of memory in a computer's RAM that is used for temporary storage of data 
during program execution.
it operates on a Last-In-First-Out (LIFO) basis
"Last-In-First-Out" (LIFO) is a principle that describes the behavior of a stack data structure
In a LIFO system, the last item added to the stack is the first one to be removed

there are few terms used for stack

>> Pushing: When you add an item to the stack 
items are always pushed on the top 
>> Popping: When you remove an item from the stack 
items are always poped from the top

>> stackpointer:
The stack pointer is a special register or memory location within a computer's CPU  that keeps 
track of the top of the stack in memory. It stores the memory address of the most recently pushed 
items onto the stack or the next available space for a new item to be pushed.
